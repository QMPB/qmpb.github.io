This is the 13th time NIAB has run its Quantitative Methods in Plant Breeding course. The course was devised and created at NIAB by Professor Ian Mackay (now of Implant Consultancy Ltd. and SRUC, <i.j.mackay@gmail.com>) from discussions with Mike Kearsey, Noel Ellis, Wayne Powell and Andy Greenland about the need for training for plant breeders and what and how NIAB could contribute. Ian also wrote this course manual and has contributed to forming the new tutorials. 

This is the 7th time in which I have taught on the NIAB QMPB course. Like so many participants over the years, Ian has stimulated my thinking on all aspects of plant breeding and I have learnt a great deal from him. I hope I can continue to add to the wealth of knowledge and practical learning that he has developed in the course.

Over the years, the course has also benefitted from the input of several guest lecturers, as well as assistance in lecturing and demonstrating from colleagues in the John Bingham Laboratory at NIAB. In particular, we would like to recognise the enthusiastic contributions of our former NIAB colleague, Greg Mellers, who sadly passed away in late 2019.

All the course administration has been handled by NIABâ€™s Mary MacPhee. I would also like to thank Tally Wright, Nick Fradgley, Camila Zanella, Joachim Nwezeobi and Yeorgia Argirou for their roles in preparing and teaching the course and Joseph Amosu for managing the IT support.
